    <h1 class="display-5">What Is Counseling?</h1>
    <p class="lead">&nbsp &nbsp Counseling is a process where clients are helped in dealing with their personal and
      interpersonal
      conflicts by a third-party therapist. It allows an individual to have an opportunity to improve upon their
      understanding of themselves, including their pattern of thoughts, behaviours, feelings and the ways in which these
      may have been problematic in their lives. It also helps to examine how to tap into existing resources or develop
      new ones that enhance their lives and relationships.</p>



    <h1 class="display-6 pt-3">Online Counseling:</h1>
    <p class="lead">&nbsp &nbsp The internet is the most preferred form of communication in the present time. Online
      counseling is counseling provided through the medium of the internet, via email, real time chat and video
      conferencing. There are several benefits to online counseling, some being accessibility (anyone with internet
      connection can access counselors), affordability (economical for both the counselor and the patient), convenience
      (can avail counseling at preferred time), social stigma (do not need to visit the therapist, and hence, there is
      no fear of being ‘caught’), anonymity (no need to reveal the true identity of the patient) and variant forms of
      communication.</p>

    <p class="lead">&nbsp &nbsp Counseling” is a very broad category that encompasses many opportunities in any number
      of counseling subfields. Counselors and therapists help their clients in a variety of ways, depending upon the

        </div>
        <div class="col-7">
          <p class="lead">&nbsp &nbsp Individual counseling is a one on one counseling process of a patient and a
            trained
            psychiatrist, psychotherapist or psychologist, where the patient seeks to achieve certain goals. It is
            mainly a process of self-discovery and overcoming your problems, where a person works out his/her issues
            under the guidance of an expert. Individual counseling is popular because it provides the setting for a
            patient to talk openly about his/her problems and disclose his/her feelings, without fear of being judged.
            Individual counseling helps patients explore themselves better and work out their issues, and basically
            discuss issues which they may not be comfortable discussing with others.</p>

          <p class="lead">&nbsp &nbsp As the name suggests, relationship counseling is the counseling that the parties
            of a relationship undergo, in order to resolve relationship issues and foster better relationships.
            Typically, relationship counseling involves couple therapy, which is a subset of relationship therapy, where
            partners involved in a romantic relationship seek therapy, however relationship counseling is not confined
            to those involved in a romantic or sexual relationship. It could be relationship counseling between parents
            and a child, boss and an employee etc. Marriage counseling is counseling of parties to a marriage, either
            before marriage or after marriage. It could be for a specific problem, or to remove the general toxicity of
            a relationship.</p>

            setting, and could also involve help in selection of colleges to best suit the student's needs and
            requirements. However, it could also be for professionals who want to switch careers or want to learn how to

            provide career counselling, based on the options available to students and also help students with their
            personal issues. The most important duty of an educational counselor is to understand the hopes, aspirations
            and dreams of a student. They should know the strengths and weaknesses of the student, and handle them very
            carefully. They also interact with parents, guardians, and other administrators regarding a student’s
            behavioural, academic, and other problems.</p>
